# CS380
Classwork for CS380

I use netbeans IDE when I work on windows machines, so my .gitignore file will be full of netbean's necessary files.

If the java files you are looking for are not in the correct folder, check the /src/ folder under that excercise/project folder

I will create a new branch after finishing/before creating a project/assingment, so that if I go back to reuse and edit old code the original, submitted copy, is saved.
